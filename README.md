# DDD_firebase_framework

This project is an extension of the DDD firebase that ResoCoder created.

Instead of sending the user to the Notes Widget the app sends to an InternalNavigator that is able to switch between different screens like tabs without loosing their state.

Comments in english are provided for this new piece...

Yes.. it's full of spanish comments in the ResoCoder piece... but it was just for me to understand how the framework works
